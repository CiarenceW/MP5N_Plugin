# MP5N-Plugin
The latest select-fire SMG with burst-fire mode for Receiver 2!<br>

Also check out: [MagLoaderThing](https://github.com/CiarenceW/MagLoaderThing), this un-cuts a thing in the Compound that makes reloading big magazines less of a chore  
And [this](https://github.com/CiarenceW/r2_CustomCompoundAmmoBoxes) as well, it adds ammo boxes for modded cartridges in the Compound, with possibilities of adding custom models for them too!

 ## Usage
 - If you insert a mag into the gun with its slide closed, it'll take a bit of force to really push it in, press Z (by default) (I hate QWERTY keyboards) to really slam that bad boy in there
 - Go to the debug menu, and start the custom campaign, or go to the debug menu and spawn the gun + mag in.<br>
 - Press V (by default) to change fire modes.<br>
 - The sights are zeroed to like 5-10 meters or something
